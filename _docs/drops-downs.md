# You Did It!

You did awesome today!! you learned something new, you had a little stress. but you tried to over come it. you needs _a Bit of help_ I will say that but you tried. okay I will say that. I will give you that and you tried something new. something out of your comfort zone. and not in your usual zone.

With that in mind. you should pat yourself on the back for learning something new today. Courtney learned some markdown today! your on the path to geekdom Bp. lol just kidding. but this is a great outlet let me tell you. no one can take knowledge from you. I think that is why I am so addicted to it. **NO ONE** can strip it away from me, unlike other things.
but anyways

# Docs What, How, Why

## Docs What

Docs are a section other than blog posts that are more solid. they are represented as more than just than the usual 'one off' with a title and a date. and you write and then move to the next. Docs stay in place and do not go anywhere. they keep there placement in the docs space on the floating menu bar on the docs page. 

## How do I make a doc?

Well you are going to do it slightly different to make a doc.
Docs belong inside a page. do they are not 'there own page'.

so **no**

- `layout: post`

the others **yes** 

- `title: your title`
- `date: yyyy:mm:dd hh:mm:ss: -0500`
- `author: person or initals.` <- if you like of course.

### How Do I Add? When Complete

add either the name of file to an existing 'title' inside of _data/docs.yml
or 
add a new 'title' inside of _data/docs.yml
