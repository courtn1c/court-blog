### I Have A Sketchy Past, Yet I Have Shed My Wings
#### You look so good tonight 
##### (I gotta have you)
#### Break Down Those Walls Tonight, You Look So Good
##### (I Gotta Have You Now)

To the 7-11 guy that I left my name and number for who hasn't called or texted me: I knew you wouldn't, so I'm not pissed at you. I'm bummed though and I'm pissed at myself. There was a disconnect between my rational conscious and naive subconscious mind. Consciously and rationally, I knew you wouldn't text me because I'm me and nothing works out for me like that; I don't get what I want - not in that way. I don't get the guy. Subconsciously though, I was thinking there was a chance and you might actually text me because I do have a pretty face and I'm a pretty cool person; weird, but cool. But you wouldn't know that because I don't ever talk when I see you because you're so attractive that it intimidates me and makes me nervous. Anyway, subconsciously, I did think there was a chance. So there was that disconnect. Obviously unaware. Until I was overcome with these feelings of sadness and disappointment. Then I was forced to confront the reality that my subconscious mind is an irrationally naive idealist whereas consciously, I am (depending on who you ask) a rational (for the most part, when it counts) realist. There's a fine line between pessimism and realism, optimists can't see it, but it's there. I'm not a negative pessimist. It was just my reality that chances were you wouldn't actually call or text me. Now, whoever happens to stumble upon my blog and actually reads it: I can guarantee you that this won't be the last time you hear about this guy, whose name is Jacob, by the way. And for the record, I will never be going into that 7-11 ever again. I'd rather push my car across a major highway to get to the next gas station if I ran out of gas than to stop at that 7-11. I can't show my face there again, ever. I gave it to his young buddy and told him to only give it to Jacob if he thought he'd be interested, otherwise just burn it. There was a girl standing next to him, also young. So if that 7-11 social community operates anything like the social information exchange within the ENTIRE Publix Lakeland Division, and as fast, chances are that quite a few people know about it by now. So, yea....never going in there again. I don't handle rejection very well. My heart would beat so fast that it would just stop and I would pass out and die. I'd like to stay alive for the time being. Tall, dark-haired-blue-eyed, handsome af Jacob, it was nice seeing you physically. I'll now have to settle for looking at your facebook until I eventually get over this particular, obsession, I guess is what you would technically call it. Until then, whoever reads this will just have to read about my unhealthy, crazy, and creepy af habits of creepin on his facebook. I mean, it's 2017, everyone does it. You're only thinking I'm crazy and creepy because I'm blatantly admitting it publicly. Quite frankily my dear, I don't give a damn. I won't hide who I am.
